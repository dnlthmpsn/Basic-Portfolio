        <p>Hey, My name is Daniel, and that handsome black dog is Merlin. He's my moms dog; 
        a christmas present from my siblings and me. It was sort of to make up for the skydiving accident
         (I took my mom sky diving. It took a log of nagging. She finally said yes. She broke her ankle on the landing.)
        </p>
<br>
         <p>So we bought her a puppy for Christmas. We also gave her Merlin because we are dog people
        and our house had been dogless for a long time. We named him Merlin because.. he's magic. 
        </p>
<br>
        <p>I grew up in Toronto and Oakville. As a kid and teenager I was obsessed with basketball. I played at U of Guelph and Queen's before 
        stopping because of a concussion. Basketball was my first Love, after my family, Michael, Deborah, Ian, Rachel (parents + older brother + older sister)
    </p>
<br>
        <p>
            I studied geography and agricultural business at Guelph, and economics at Queen's. Coincidently (not coincidently) the same year I moved to Queen's (located in Kingston)
            my family (as in my parents, Michael and Deborah), moved our family home to Kingston. My mom had recently taken a faculty position at Queen's in nursing. 
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
         After my concussion I started paying attention more in school and really ended up enjoying my program. My only grade below an A was in a third year course "Computational methods in economics and finance".
        The Professor started on the first day by guarenteeing everyone and A.. but that's a different story. I was accepted to the Queen's econ masters program, but turned it down and moved to Vancouver. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        I moved to Vancouver for mountain air and startup vibes. Two friends and I were attempting to solve the problem of loneliness and isolation, in particular amongst university students. 
        The idea really resonated with a lot of people that we spoke to, but we did not resonate as a team, so I packed up and moved back to Ontario, Kingston specifically. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>   
        Shortly after moving back I found a job at a very small startup in Toronto. At first a contract position, then a full-time position on the product development team. 
        My experience in University, being a self starter, and working for other entrepreneurs have melded together
        to ultimately convince me that it's time to take the plunge; so here I am!  </p>
