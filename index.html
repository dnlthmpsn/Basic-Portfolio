        <p>Hey, My name is Daniel, and that handsome black dog is Merlin. He's my moms dog; 
                a christmas present from my siblings and me. It was sort of to make up for the skydiving accident.                           
                 I took my mom skydiving and she really enjoyed it, but she broke her ankle on the landing. So we bought her a puppy for Christmas. </p>
                   <p>We also gave her Merlin because we are dog people and our house had been dogless for a long time. We named him Merlin because.. he's magic. My experience in University, 
                   being a self starter, and working for other entrepreneurs have melded together to ultimately convince me that it's time to take the plunge; so here I am!</p>
